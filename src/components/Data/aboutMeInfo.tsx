    "Everything began when our first computer came home. I was a child, so I didn't quite understand what was that useful for? But then I started getting interested in it since I saw it could run video games and this little discovery forged my future.",
    "Those long hours behind the screen installing software (mostly games), troubleshooting audio and video drivers when things go south paid very well. I still remember, as a teenager being paid by an uncle by setting up his printer and from this point on, I became the favorite pc-boy-technician of my relatives.",
    "Since then I have been working on IT Operations (Ops) and it's being a wonderful journey. A few years ago while attending my first computer programming lecture at the university, I learned some basic coding stuff. ",
    "At first, it was really hard for me to grasp the abstractions of programming like objects and classes. I still remember having a hard time adding two numbers like 2+2 and getting 22 as a result.",
    "One day, while looking for how to code on google (literally) I found an article titled 'tips to learn programming'. The author recommended something so basic and so overlooked by myself, it was \"Learn By Doing\" and that was it. The key to truly undestand the concepts of programming is by coding not just reading.",
    "This new mind setup is what opened the door to a new whole level. Now I can add numbers and get the right answer and much more.",
    "Being able to code is like having superpowers.",
